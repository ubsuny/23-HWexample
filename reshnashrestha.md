# Computational PHY 505 Fall 2023

### Things that I would like to learn in this semester:
- Learn coding using languages like python and c++.
- Increase my familarity in programming tools like visual studio, git and github.
- Create git repository and learn to commit, pull request and merge code.
- Learn to work in group project using Google colab and IBM Quantum Computing.
- Write my own code for various tasks and understand the codes written by others.

 #### For example: 
 I would like to write a well formatted code in python for finding a factorial of a number. At least, I am trying as follows:

 ```python

def factorial(n):
    if n == 0:
        return 1
    else:
        return n * factorial(n - 1)
print(factorial(16))
